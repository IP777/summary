    I would like to change my current occupation from an engineer-architect to a
    web application developer. Over the course of 2 years I have been actively
    studying web development technologies HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJs.
    I have experience in team development of React applications. Also I have
    basic knowledge of creating Node.js server with MongoDB. I am interested in
    PHP and jQuery library. I would like to obtain a position in a company that
    offers interesting projects with growth potencial in terms of individual and
    professional development.
